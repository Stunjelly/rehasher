Simple python/gtk based script that swaps out OPF identifiers for new UUID identifers (and can swap them back again).

This will rehash your iTunes meta data according to this blog(http://web.me.com/david.mundie/Linden_Log/Blog/Entries/2010/6/2_Dealing_with_iBooks_Caching.html), and get iBooks to see a different file (i.e. no horrible caching or black screens).

Hopefully should save people some time, however bare in mind that this tool has no error reporting as of yet, and could possibly make a real mess of things (make copies! we would not like to be held responsible for destroying all your work!).

setup.py is for py2exe to build standalone exe files for windows with no python installed. Just run the main.py file if you have python and gtk installed.
